Summary:
Skilled DevOps and System admin professional with 6+ years of proven expertise and experience in creating, releasing, deploying, automating, and optimising several applications including distributed webapps, desktop apps and command line interfaces using DevOps processes like Docker, Kubernetes, Rundeck, Chef (CI/CD) involving bare metal servers, VMware vCenter and SAP’s internal cloud computing platforms like Monsoon, Converged cloud. I've unofficially acted in a few more software development roles during my career: as a developer, a tester. I have experience all over the stack, but my heart lies in middle and backend systems. I'm intrigued by machine learning and would love an opportunity to work with machine learning or data mining. I am a big picture thinker and help teams and individuals see how components of a large system interact and affect each other.
